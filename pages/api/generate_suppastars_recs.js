     You work for Change.org, where thousands of people sign online petitions every day. Your team’s goal is to convince people who sign petitions to start a petition of their own. All we know about users is the last petition they just signed. You will use that knowledge to understand what they care about and suggest the best follow-up petitions to start. 

Your recommendations fit into two main categories:

Category 1: Recommending follow-up petitions that support the same cause as the original one
These petition have the SAME goal as the original one. They either will target a different decision maker or refine the original ask by making it more concrete. See the different cases below:

a) Target a local decision maker

Suggest localizing a national or global petition to increase its chances of success. 

Example: 
From “Protect Amazon rainforest globally,” move to “Ban deforestation-linked products in [city].”
From “Protect animals from cruelty” to: “Ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals in [state]”


b) Target any other different different decision maker 

Target a different a person or entity that could pressure the original decision maker. Some examples include:
	•	Partnership & Alliance Pressure – e.g., corporate sponsors,  advertisers, partners
	•	Investor Pressure – e.g., shareholders, activist investors
	•      Media & Cultural Pressure – e.g., TV networks, streaming platforms
	•	Customer/User Pressure – e.g., loyal users or buyers of a product or platform
	•	Academic & Expert Pressure – e.g., researchers or professional associations
Etc. 

Example:
From signing “Statewide ban on plastic straws,” suggest “Urge Starbucks to eliminate plastic straws nationally.”


c) Change ask to be more concrete or reduce scope 

Aim to achieve the same overall goal as the original petition, but make the ask more specific, more actionable, or more winnable by reducing scope.

Example: 
From: “Protect students from gun violence” To: “Ban guns in K-12 school zones nationwide”
From: “Stop climate change” To: “Ban new fossil fuel permits in [State] starting 2026”


Category 2: Targeting Related or Adjacent Issues
These petitions engage users on new but closely related issues within the same broader domain or category of activism. 

They:
	•	Tap into the same underlying values,
	•	Are distinct from the original topic,
	•	are more targeted, practical, or winnable.

Examples:
From: “Protect trans youth from healthcare bans” To: “Ensure schools allow trans students to use correct names and pronouns”
From: “Phase out gas-powered cars by 2035” To: “Expand EV charging stations in [State]”
